# Speech Emotion Recognition 
## Introduction
This project focuses on recognizing emotions from speech using deep learning techniques and provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. The model is trained to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., from speech audio input.

## Features
- Emotion recognition from speech using deep learning models.
- User interface powered by Streamlit for easy interaction.
- Support for various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
- Real-time emotion prediction from speech input.

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning
- Streamlit
- Python

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Speech-Emotion-Recognition
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the Streamlit server:
    ```bash
